# ScalaChess
## Chess GUI written in Scala



This is being written as a Scala learning exercise. I am particularly interested in
suggestions on how the code can be made more functional and generally adopt a more
Scala orientated approach instead of the current Javaesque style.

This project is written using TDDD - TODO Driven Design.
